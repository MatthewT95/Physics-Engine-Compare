Instructions:
  Move the player to the blue target and remain there until level is complete. 
  The target will move to a new location when the level is completed.
  Your ship will explode, game over, if you get two close to the black mines.
  More mines will appear each level and they will move and bounce off walls.

  Movement:
    Constant-velocity:
      The ship will move at a constant velocity when the movement keys are held down.
      A to move left.
      D to move right.
      W to move up.
      S to move down.
    Acceleration:
      The ship will accelerate at a constant acceleration when the movement keys are held down.
      A to accelerate left.
      D to accelerate right.
